# Personalised web

A proof of concept demonstrating AI-powered, per-user website customization on cloudflare infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

Visit the deployed instance: [here!](https://cloudflare-bun-spa-website-art.theredxer.workers.dev) and start customising your own version of the site via the personalised input box.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

This project was inspired by [@threepointone's tweet](https://x.com/threepointone/status/1977822605748097241) about the future of personalized web experiences:

> "there's this line of code that I couldn't have imagined building at any point in my career that's possible today:
>
> `return new Response(generatePersonalisedPage({user})`
>
> every user gets an ai agent assigned to them, in a 15ms radius, with it's own memory and state and whatever. And for your website, for every user, you can spin up a sandbox to generate a page (real code!) based just on their own preferences and vibes (changing over time).
>
> Kind of insane. Someone should build this and kill it in the ecommerce game."

## How it works

This proof of concept demonstrates how each user can request and prompt their own personalized version of a website. The system:

- **User-specific customizations** - Each user can request a peronsalised version of the site with preferences which are generated and served to the user
- **Stores per-user customizations** - Each user's preferences and requests are remembered
- **Caches personalized pages** - Serves custom pages instantly for returning users
- **Smart re-rendering** - If the base page changes, it automatically re-applies user customizations to the new version instead of serving stale cached content


### Example Personalizations

**Person A:**
- "I don't care about offers"
- "Optimize for mobile"
- "I hate calzone"

**Person B:**
- "Show me the best deals first"
- "I am colorblind"
- "Make the text large"

Each user gets their own unique version of the site, tailored to their preferences and accessibility needs, while always reflecting the latest content.
